h1. Thorium Scripting Language

Thorium is a powerful embedded scripting language written in FreePascal.
It features a pluggable compiler and typing system, and ships with easy
and fast import of host classes using RTTI. It also allows to call host
methods and functions _without the need for wrapper functions_, thus
saving the developer (that is you) the time to write these.
